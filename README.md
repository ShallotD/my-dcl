🧩 Workflow Summary
🟦 1. Credit Operations (Creator)

Creates a new Document Checklist using createDCL.jsx, lists required documents, and assigns it to a Relationship Manager.

🟨 2. Relationship Manager (RM)

Uploads required documents, requests deferment if needed, and submits the checklist back for review.

🟦 3. Credit Operations (Creator) – Review Stage

Approves or rejects the RM's uploaded documents.
If rejected → sent back to RM.
If approved → sent to Checker.

🟩 4. Credit Operations (Checker) – Final Approval

Performs final validation and marks the workflow as Completed.

________________________________________
Additionally:
✔️ Auto-load all checklist items as originally created
When the Creator opens an item:
